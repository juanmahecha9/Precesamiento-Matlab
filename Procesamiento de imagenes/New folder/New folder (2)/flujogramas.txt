Reduction of the image by a factor k

start

Load the image into a variable

Sub-sample the image

Parac each pixel equidistant or sample, depending on the factor you want

Example: a11 a12 a13 a14 with factor 2

Starts in the pixel in the first position and jumps row and column in the desired factor, discarding the others

Analogically it would be like generating the module of each row and column in the position of the factor and letting the module be 0

Generate the new matrix where the new components will be saved

Show the image

end
-------------------------------------------------------------------------


Image Expansion

start

Generate two for cycles that point to point the matrix generating the limits of height and width of the image

Generate two more cycles that generate a sweep in the new position and generate new positions in the high and wide sense depending on the factor

Because the matrix is ??symmetrical, the equation to be used to generate the exchange and new positions that have to be acquired per pixel will multiply the value of i, j by the value of k and begin to restate the new limits, That they will adition the new position

Close foor loops and show the new image

end
-----------------------------------------------------------------


Reduction and grayscale expansion

start

The image is composed of 8 grays ie 256

To the naked image applies a rule of three that generates the new characteristics

The new bits to which the image is set are 2 ^ n bits

Show image

end

Boundary Window

First assign the image to a new matrix that can be modified

Now that new image becomes double to be able to operate the data of the matrix

Generate two for cycles to generate image boundaries

Within the two cycles for is generated the mathematical operation of the pixels around the pixel that is operated at the moment this operation is an average and is assigned to the position evaludad, and to generate the reduction in 2, the Counting limits 2 in 2

Finally print the new image

end
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Binarization of the image from the histogram

Generate an empty vector of the length of the width or height of the image

Generate two for cycles for the point-to-point sweep of the matrix

Analyze in the vector the points of the image equating it to the same one but with the différence to add 1 is to generate generate a counter of that is repeated in the matrix

At the end of the cycles, print the histogram

Now find the maximum value of the vector

With a higher forite cycle equal to the last position of the vector, find at what position of i generates that maximum value which works for the vinarization

The vinarization is generated by sweeping point to point the original image or the one used in the histogram

With a condiconal if generate a new limit, it is say if the value of the pixel is greater than the limit that was found in the histogram it is assigned to 255 and the smaller ones to 0

To have the binarized image
Show the image
